1)  Make the plot look more organized          -         Not necessary anymore                  
2)  Bring the register button closer to the slider   -   Done  
3)  Add 'reset' button           -                       Done
4)  Change the notification setting           -          Done
5)  Try out the two-ray model              -             Done
6)  In the pathloss experiment make 
    changes so that the plots are of different   -       Done 
    colors for different heights of antennas
7)  Make the antennas in the diversity experiment    -   Done
    linear from circular.
8)  Check whether the Two-ray model is working
    correctly or not (for scenario 2)          -         
9)  Add a background to the Two-ray model     -          
10) Add signal plots to the Two-ray model      -         
11) Change the multiantenna svg for the model     -      
12)

GitHub Pending
1) Figure out the 404 error for the.. something regarding the gh-pages
2) Change the font of the 'Theory' section of the experiment 'Multiplexing vs Diversity'
3) Formula not clearly visible in the Theory section of the experiment 'Two-ray Model'. Also, the mathematical letters are not properly visible
4)
